          <p>Frank Lloyd Wright designed over 1,000 structures throughout his career. This includes houses, offices, churches, schools, skyscrapers, hotels, and museums. A few of his most notable works include Fallingwater, and the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, and the Jacobs House. Wright's architectural style has had a significant impact on modern architecture.</p>

            <h2>Minimalistic Interior Design</h2>
            <p>Wright championed simplicity and functionality in interior design. He crafted uncluttered, functional spaces that emphasized comfort. Clean lines, minimal ornamentation, and built-in furniture and storage solutions characterized his designs, creating interiors that exuded practicality and grace.</p>
            <p>Most admirers of Frank Lloyd Wright associate his designs with the minimalistic approach. He knew when to leave something and when to get rid of it. Homes designed by Wright often took a very simple approach, since eliminating any insignificant design feature helped to create sophisticated homes without anything unnecessary.</p>

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <h2>Use of Natural Materials</h2>
            <p>Wright's respect for natural materials further defined his design philosophy. He believed that materials like wood, stone, and textiles lent warmth and a connection to the natural world. Throughout his interiors, elements such as wood paneling, stone fireplaces, and wool or linen textiles showcased his dedication to this principle.</p>
            <p>He was not afraid to use new building materials when designing and building homes. Instead of the traditional lead, which was utilized during the time, he used zinc cames for leadlight windows. He was also one of the first designers to use precast concrete bricks and glass bricks in his design.</p>

                  The Prairie style, which was popular in early 20th-century America, is marked by horizontal lines, open layouts, and natural materials. It was developed by Frank Lloyd Wright, and influenced by Arts and Crafts, and emphasizes harmony with the environment.</p>  
                  
                <p>Wright's Prairie homes utilize low-pitched roofs and ample windows to blend with nature, as well as prioritize openness and light. Their impact on American architecture is profound, inspiring architects and homeowners alike with their beauty and simplicity.</p>

                <p><small></small></p>
                <p>Wright used "Usonia" to represent the United States, embodying his urban planning and architectural ideals. Originating around the turn of the 20th century, the Usonian style gained traction in the 1930s.</p>

                <p>These homes, stemming from the original Usonian house, were built with concrete blocks to reduce costs. Wright's aim was to empower homeowners to create their own blocks and construct their homes, thus saving money. The term 'Usonian Automatic' described Wright's innovative concrete building system.</p>

                <p><small></small></p>
                <p>The Organic Architecture was developed by Frank Lloyd Wright, and he believed architecture should study and honour nature, and be inspired by it. "We do not live in nature, we live in it", he stated. Thus, our buildings should be built in, not on, nature.</p>

                <p>The architecture involves a respect for the properties of the materials. Using local materials and integrating what was already there, Wright created living spaces in which nature was amplified rather than ignored and added to the beauty of the landscape.</p>
